###Polymorphism in simpler terms means “many forms” 



Firstly, we’ll just create a class that will hold our main method.



Next, let’s create a class  (which is a blueprint for objects)  that represents a type of something (i.e Dogs, Cars, Birds, etc.)

Everything inside of a class = variables and methods 


Now we Create a method that performs an action for when we make instantiated objects of this class 



To test the method, Create an object in main and invoke the method upon said object 



Now, create another class that is a sub-type of a car (Mercedes, Ram, Jeep, etc.) 



Now let’s make it a sub-class of Cars 

- This means everytime we make a “whatever car” object, it recognizes everything inside of the Cars class 



Now, the sub class will perform the same exact method that was created under Cars.. but what if THIS specific car (sub class) does the same thing in a different way?

-Now you can take the same exact method we declared in Cars, copy/ paste it in the sub class, and adjust it to perform something differently 



###Java prioritizes the method directly in the class



This is an example of a polymorphic method. It consists of many versions of the same method, but prioritizes whatever is in each sub class. It also allows for the ability of an object to identify  as more than one type. 



###You can create as many sub classes of cars that you want
